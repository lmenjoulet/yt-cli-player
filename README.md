# yt-cli-player

## A Youtube command line audio player

Not really beautiful nor intuitive for now, but working on linux and windows if you have an audio output, only single videos are supported for the moment, might change later but my main focus is to make a cleaner interface for now.

## requirements

nodejs 14.15+ with npm
If you're running it on windows make sure to have [windows-build-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools) enabled globally, not needed if you installed all the necessary build tools at nodejs installation.

## running

After cloning, go to the project directory and run 
```
npm install
```

to install the dependencies needed, you only need to do it once.

Then run 
```
npm run start
```
every time you want to run it.
